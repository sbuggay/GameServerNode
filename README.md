## Default ports
Default ports are UDP/27015-27019. Make sure these are open in your firewall and forwarded through your router if the server is behind one.
UDP/27020 is reserved for SourceTV.

Source games will start at 27015 and progress towards 27019. After 5 servers you must specify the port you want.

## Server templates
At initial setup GameServerNode will set up your server templates.
